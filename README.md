### PlayWM - power of adjusting together with beauty of ready solution

#### Mission

The reason why I've started this project was feeling stupid. 
Seriously, this is easy to use window manager for Linux, but with architecture goals which suits quite active Linux user and software programmer.

Whenever I see window manager which looks elegant and has all modern and fast and pleasant functionality I have to deal with limited configuration dialog boxes, making me feel stupid, that I cannot change basic things! Last time I had this feeling using very attractive Gnome3...

On the other hand if I found very enjoyable to hack manager, it is so minimalistic that is hard to look longer than at ugly girl without alcohol.

So here is PlayWM, window manager which has many modern eye candies (like transparency in taskbar) and rich functionality (like auto placement for my Download window) but having clever configuration.

That configuration is perfect for people loving play with computers. Imagine that to change every aspect of PlayWm one need to change small and well documented text files, all in one place, with configuration auto-reloading. 

Check it out!

#### Information for Non-developers
Welcome everybody to PlayWM!

PlayWM is a window manager which was intended to play with its configuration. This way every curious user, not only advanced linux geeks, can change how looks and behave his desktop and windows on it. Also if you don't have time to read all documentation, PlayWM is fast startup.

How to play? After staring PlayWM first time, go to `~/.playwm` directory and read `START.txt` file.

In `~/.playwm` directory you can find all configuration files for different components of PlayWM. PlayWM is like LEGO toys. It is build from different application joined in one place, and well documented.

To play with PlayWM we need to change those files, using documentations provided inside those files. It is possible because documentation is clear and written as a comments.

Have fun!
