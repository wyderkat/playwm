Welcome everybody to PlayWM!

PlayWM is a window manager which was intended to play with it's configuration.
This way every curious user, not only advanced linux geeks, can change how looks
and behave his/her desktop and windows on it. 

How to play? After staring PlayWM first time, go to ~/.playwm directory and
read START.txt file. Since you are reading it now, we can begin:)

In ~/.playwm directory we can find all configuration files for different
components of PlayWM. PlayWM is like LEGO toys. It is build from different
application joined in one place, and well documented. 

To play with PlayWM we need to change those files, using documentations provided
in inside those files. It is possible because documentation is clear and written
as a comments.

To avoid reading all documentation read just header (marked as a 
  MUST TO READ - HEADER
) and follow instructions or table of contents provided there. 

One file which we need to read from first line till the bottom is this file:
->  START.txt
OK, lets start by making necessary notes about architecture of PlayWM.

Core of PlayWM is OpenBox window manager by Dana Jansens (and now also others).
But what you will be probably looking at after starting PlayWM is the panel on
the top of the screen. This is Tint2 application by Thierry Lorthiois and
Andreas Fink. 

If you want to change how looks and works this top panel go to 
->  task.bar.tint2rc 
file.

The same Tint2 application runs on the right edge of screen. To configure go to
->  launch.bar.tint2rc

What about that core of PlayWM - OpenBox? Here are most of options to change. 
If you want to change desktop wallpaper or add application to start when PlayWM
starts go to:
->  autostart.openbox.sh

If you want to change keybindings, mousebindings or any advanced/internal
part of window manager go to :
->  windows.openbox.xml

To change menu go to 
->  menu.openbox.xml

After changing any configuration file, type make in a ~/.playwm directory to
refresh/restart components.  Make also backup copy of files you are changing for
own safety. 

To view logs from running command go to
->  log/
directory.

That's it. Have fun playing PlayWM.
