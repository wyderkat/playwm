Welcome everybody to PlayWM!

PlayWM is a window manager which was intended to play with its configuration.
This way every curious user, not only advanced Linux geek, can change how looks
and behaves his/her desktop and windows on it. Also if you don't have time to
read all documentation, PlayWM is fast startup. 

How to play? After staring PlayWM first time, go to .playwm directory in your
home directory and read START.txt file. Since you are reading it now, we can
begin:)

In ~/.playwm directory you can find all configuration files for different
components of PlayWM. PlayWM is like LEGO toys. It is build from different
application joined in one place and well documented. 

To play with PlayWM you need to change those files, using documentations provided
inside those files. It is possible because documentation is short and written
as a comments.

To avoid reading all documentation read just header (marked as a 
  MUST TO READ - HEADER
) and follow instructions or table of contents provided there. 

One file which you need to read from first line till the bottom is this file
which you are ridding now:
->  START.txt
OK, lets start by making necessary notes about architecture of PlayWM.

Core of PlayWM is OpenBox Window Manager by Dana Jansens (and now also others).
But what you will be probably looking at after starting PlayWM is the panel on
the top of the screen. This is Tint2 application by Thierry Lorthiois and
Andreas Fink. 

If you want to change how looks and works that top panel go to 
->  task.bar.tint2rc 
file.

The same Tint2 application is running on the right edge of screen. To configure
go to
->  launch.bar.tint2rc

What about that core of PlayWM - OpenBox? Here are most of options to change. 
If you want to change desktop wallpaper or add application to start when PlayWM
starts go to:
->  autostart.openbox.sh

If you want to change key bindings or mouse bindings, to control your PlayWM,
go to:
->  keyboard.openbox.xml
->  mouse.openbox.xml
file respectively.

To change menu go to 
->  menu.openbox.xml

In PlayWM you can automatize some window management. Go to file
-> applications.openbox.xml
to set up for example what desktop your mail client should pop up when started.


For more advanced/internal part of window manager go to :
->  internal.openbox.xml

Very important for PlayWM is terminal. By default PlayWM uses Urxvt terminal. In
->  terminal.Xresources
you will find options to tune it.

Probably most complicated is look/theme design for Openbox application. Start
from here:
-> theme/openbox-3/themerc
Inside themerc/openbox-3 directory you can find also some image files, but go
first to mentioned location.

File
-> fonts.conf 
isn't only settings for PlayWM. It is related to all your fonts in all window
managers. But it is so important to have easy readable text that we decided to
preconfigure this 
for you too. 

After changing any configuration file, type 
  make 
command when being in a ~/.playwm directory. This will refresh/restart PlayWM
components to new configuration. Make also backup copy of files you are
changing for your own safety. 

To view logs from running command go to
->  log/
directory.

That's it. Have fun playing PlayWM.
